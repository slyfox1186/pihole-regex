## BROWSER-BASED SERVICES 
## (More specific domains are way below)
# Below are the top-level URLs for Adobe websites that provide access to Creative Cloud services and are 
# accessed from a browser. The applications listed right most column are those that were known at time of 
# publication to access these websites. Again, due to Creative Cloud updates, it is possible that other applications 
# not listed also access those websites.
# 
# Blocking these URLs blocks access to storage from most or all sync/store/share services, the administrative control 
# panel for users and teams, and other facilities accessed via the Creative Cloud website. It does not block access to 
# services such as Typekit which has its own access points. In order to block access to sync/store/share and not block 
# access to managing user accounts, make sure that administrators are exempted from the block.
